# Welcome to Solved-Problems

Welcome to **DSA's Solved-Problems**, This is the place where you showcase your approach of solving various question with different difficult levels. By sharing your solutions, you not only illuminate the depths of your coding proficiency but also contribute to a vibrant community that fosters inspiration, knowledge exchange, and connections with fellow enthusiasts.

## Points to Remember

- **Maintain the File Structure:** Make sure you follow the file structure which was discussed indetail in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md "goto CONTRIBUTING.md").
- **Solving a new problem:** If you wish to add your own solution for the problem that has not been solved till the point you have forked this repo, then create a new directory by following the naming convension *(refer [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md "goto CONTRIBUTING.md"))*. Create a new directory even though your solution is a single file.
- **Someone solved your problem:** If you find that someone has already solved the problem that you are looking to contribute, you can still add your solution to the same directory as long as the your solution has either a different approach or using a different programming lanuguage.
- **Avoid Duplication:** Do Not Create new directories for the problems that have already been solved. Use the same directory so that others can easily naivage to their required problem.
- **Document your Problem:** There are 2 things that are needed to be discussed regarding this point:
  - **Provide reference for the problem:** Providing reference for the problem will help other to look into resources/platform that you have solved and try for themselves. Use the sample template for providing the details:
    ```java
	// Problem Name: <problem-name>
	// Approach:     <data-structure> (or) <algorithm>
	// Diffculty:    <mentioned-diffculty>
	// Link:         <link-to-the-problem>
	// Others:       <any-other-reference-link>

	/* your solution */
	```

	<details>
    <summary>For example:</summary>
    <div>

    ```java
    // Problem Name: Longest Consecutive Sequence
    // Approach:     Hash Map
    // Diffculty:    Medium
    // Link:         https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence
	// Others:       https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-util-hashmap-in-java-with-examples/

    /* your solution */
    ```

    </div>
    </details>

  - **Detailed Explaination:** If you wish to explain your solution/approach used to solve the problem, then you can make use of simple [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax "visit official GitHub Markdown Docs") to explain your solution within `README.md` file. You can create a `README.md` file within your problem statement directory, so that you can help others understand your solution even better.
